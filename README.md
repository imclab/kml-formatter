kml-formatter
=============

Extracts the lithology and age from USGS KML files so they are easier to read in Google Earth.

##KML Source Files
http://mrdata.usgs.gov/geology/state/

##Outputs
- Ages KML/KMZ
- Lithic Groups KML/KMZ
- Ages with Lithic Subgroups KML/KMZ

##To Use
If you don't want to compile the source yourself, the runnable jar can be found in the /jar folder.  Run it like an executable and open a state KML (KMZ not supported) from File > Open.  Export options can be found under File.
